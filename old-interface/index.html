	<h1 style=font-size:38px>Lively Wallpaper for Chrome OS</h1>
	<p>a "port" of the original Lively Wallpaper project to Chrome OS.<br>
	NOTICE: You are currently accessing the old interface, this is no longer being fully maintained and may only be used for testing. Any information on these pages may be inaccurate/out of date.
	</p>
	<h3 style=font-size:24px>How it works</h3>
	<p>This port/demake of Lively Wallpaper I made works in a similar way that the original app does. A window containing a non-interactable YouTube embed is placed behind all apps and the shelf/taskbar. This YouTube embed is set to autoplay and loop.</p>
	<h3 style=font-size:24px>Limitations</h3>
	<p>There are a few limitations with this. First, no multiple displays. You can technically just open the app multiple times and spread the windows across your displays, but this is not the best solution and it could reduce device performance. Another limitation is no multiple desks. Because the way the app is run and the limitations of Chrome OS, the app isn't really running in the background. The app is running in the foreground but is covered in your apps. So if you made a new desk and switched to it, the wallpaper would not carry over. A solution would again be opening the app multiple times, but this is a band-aid fix to a larger problem. Not only that, but if you have multiple displays, you'd have to multiply the ammount of displays you have by the ammount of desks you have to see how many times you would have to open the app. (in my case I would have to open the app 9 times because I have 3 displays, and 3 desks.</p>
	<h3 style=font-size:24px>Need live wallpapers for Windows?</h3>
	<p>Check out the original Lively Wallpaper by rocksdanister! It has <b>a lot</b> more features and is more configurable, proper multiple display support, optimization so you can save performance and battery when an app is maximized/fullscreen, and more.</p>

	<h3 style=font-size:24px>Getting started</h3>
	<p>First, I highly recommend installing this as a PWA. There should've been a pop up message in the top right corner of the browser to install this app. If it didn't pop up, go to the Chrome menu, More tools, and click Create shortcut. Name it whatever you like, but just remember to enable "Open as window". Click "Create" and then you should now have the app in your app drawer. Now just click the link below to see the wallpapers available. When you click on your wallpaper, the page with the youtube embed will appear. Then all you have to do is press the fullscreen button on your keyboard, and to access your shelf/taskbar just move your mouse to the bottom of the screen, and open your apps.</p>

	<h3 style=font-size:24px>Planned improvements</h3>
	<p>I do plan to update and improve this to become the best that it can be under the limitations of Chrome OS without the Linux and Android functional, as my aim for this is for it to be able to be ran on any Chrome OS device such as a managed device where Linux might be disabled.</p>
